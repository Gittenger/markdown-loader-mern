need to create a function to add md to db

takes an array consisting of my local copy of all 
files which i want to upload.

could do an addOne and an addMany to allow for adding one if needed.

in addMany, for each file, query db for some YAML metadata
if match, perform update command passing in the MD string
if no match, create entry instead
