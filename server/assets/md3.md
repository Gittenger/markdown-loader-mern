# My Favorite Shortcuts

Shortcuts are an essential piece of any developer workflow. When I started programming, I knew this was going to be the case, but as I’m sure it is for most people, I didn’t yet understand which shortcuts to use or how to leverage them to really get the most out of them. When you’re starting out, there are so many things to learn, finding your favorite shortcuts can seem among the lowest priorities. However it may seem, it’s undeniably true that shortcuts are a great way to quickly level up your coding skills. In this article, I will highlight some of my favorite shortcuts so perhaps I can help you hit a new a stride of productivity.

Note: I currently use Linux Fedora, although most of these shortcuts will be near identical on Windows machines, and I’m sure a close alternative will exist on Apple machines as well.
